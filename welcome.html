			<p>It is important to have friends.I have many friends from school, university.One of my best friens name is Sevara. She studies at AUCA. It’s not easy to meet a true and faithful friend. I am happy that I have got Sevara. I trust her and I’m sure that I can rely on her in any situation. She is the single person who can ask for help and advice in unhappy moments of my life and whom I can tell all my problems. She never lets people down. I miss Seva when we don’t see each other for a long time. I think our friendship makes me feel confident; share to over feelings and opinions. Personally, I think that friendship is a great force.</p>

Without making goals in your life you would have nothing to look forward to, or even have anything to achieve. If you have the goal, every day it makes your life more colourful.</p>

			<h1>Teacher:Shambetova Burul</h1>
			<p>It is a great pleasure to write a recommendation letter for one of the best students in the course. Tansuluu Myrzaeva was my student at Programming languages 1 using Python.  She was one of the students with great intellectual abilities, whose goal was  to learn Python and make her best. She is the leader of her group, does what she have said and gives herself fully to achieve her aims. Tansuluu  is a creative thinker and an active person. These traits helped her to achieve outstanding results in studies and gain authority among the society within the university. As a student she was always among the most active ones during the class, taking part in problem solving and discussions. I am more than sure that Tansulu's hard working personality and devotion to her goal of becoming the best programmer  will assist her achieve brilliant outcomes in the future as they did to this day. I recommend her as an assistant to the Web Technologies course For further questions you can contact me by whatsapp or emai</p>

			<h1>Groupmate:Turatbekov Argen</h1>
			<p>Я знаю Мырзаеву Таню как оптимистку, добрую девушку. Трудолюбивую и помогающую всем но иногда она может кинуть тебя это тоже знайте . А так хороший человек со своими тараканами в голове, если вы её не возьмёте , то очень сильно пожалеете . Она пашет почти как робот . В конце учебу вы будете умолять её закончить ваш универ , но она вас откажет и приедет в Кыргызстан помогать Аргену(I said him that it was for exchange programm)</p>

			<h1> Sister:Kurmanbekova Elmira.</h1>
			<p> I know Tanya as a good person. She is very cheerful and active. Loves to learn someth new and also, likes to be in the course on the latest news about someone or something. You can safely entrust her the most precious thing that you have, because she is very responsible. Tanya is one of those who know how to be friends for a long time and she is the soul of the company. But, sometimes it's better not to touch her when she's not in the mood. This can be dangerous for your mood and sometimes even for your health. That's all.</p>
